A very simple program that you can use to swap to files names like the following:

You have a file, let's call it "file". But you want to do something with two different versions of it, let's call "file1" and "file2". This program will swap the files, for example, if your files are:
|-file1
|-file

It will swap to
|-file1
|-file2

And etc...

# Using

Step to step on how to use it:
1. Download the .exe
2. Drop it in the folder you want to have the files
3. Launch the .exe once.
4. Open the file `swap_rename.config`
5. Edit the names of the files how you wish
6. The program will now swap the files every time it's launched
